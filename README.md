## Known Issues
<ul>
  <li>If you mash the arrow keys sometimes it's possible to move to the opposite direction of the snake, which is obviously not intended, this happens randomly.</li>
  <li>Sometimes you can die randomly when the head gets close to where the food was located previously, this also happens randomly and still cannot replicate it voluntarily.</li>
</ul>
